Votive Dots $VERSION for Mac

1. You need macOS 14 or newer and Node.js (brew install node, or nodejs.org).
2. Open Terminal, go into this folder, and run:

     ./Scripts/install.sh

3. Look at the right side of your menu bar.

Do not double-click Votive.app. It is not notarized by Apple, so macOS will refuse it.
The installer opens it the right way. The picture guide is in docs/Votive-Dots-Quick-Guide.pdf
